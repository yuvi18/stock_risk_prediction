# Stock Risk Prediciton

## Stock2Vec

Train embeddings for stocks in same manner as we train word embeddings in NLP.

The code includes different visualizations of the data as well as statistical outputs.

Using these visualizations we have determined that 4-5 dimensions is the sweet spot for stock embeddings (at least with these sectors).
